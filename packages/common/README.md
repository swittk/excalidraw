# ex-excalidraw-common

## Install

```bash
npm install ex-excalidraw-common
```

If you prefer Yarn over npm, use this command to install the Excalidraw utils package:

```bash
yarn add ex-excalidraw-common
```

With PNPM, similarly install the package with this command:

```bash
pnpm add ex-excalidraw-common
```
